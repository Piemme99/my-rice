# Roadmap

High-level ideas for future improvements. Update as priorities shift.

- [ ] Flesh out `bootstrap/install.sh` with real guard checks, package installation, and logging.
- [ ] Port Hyprland configs from Omarchy and replace `omarchy-*` commands with local scripts.
- [ ] Implement Catppuccin theme assets for Waybar, Mako, terminals, and Neovim.
- [ ] Add Firefox policies and tweaks for Catppuccin alignment.
- [ ] Provide smoke-test scripts in `tests/` (Waybar launch, Hyprland login sanity checks).
- [ ] Document VM testing workflow using QEMU + archinstall automation.
- [ ] Evaluate greetd as alternative to SDDM and document trade-offs.
